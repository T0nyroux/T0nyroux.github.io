## ver 0.7

## ver 0.8

  its enlistment time, found a new artist to take some of the load off my back.

## ver 0.9

  Added the first challenge room of area 2, bucket puzzle functions properly, still no further rooms.

## ver 1.0!!!

 Polished up on Area 1! just missing Jenny's zombie, room 2 is functional and room 3 is ready to be coded, fast progress now!

## ver 1.1

 Progress has taken a step back again, picked up another project to work on that's a little more hectic than this one, otherwise though,
 Jenny may no longer be making the zombie, the job may have fallen on greg both as initiation for greg and motivation for Jenny,
 who thus far has made no progress... Sorry Jenny, 'Dems da facts, I am not a patient peer.
